# BEYOND

* Registration Problem (RP)
* What is the longer term rollout plan?

# HIGH


# MEDIUM

* Change URLContext format - multiple # might be an issue
* Stress test back-end - how many polls per minute?
* Clean-up/Populate old polls


* Clear only data. Not user info. To avoid multiple logins.

* Search for Poll
* Design better experience on Vote Poll - as of now, nothing really happens

# LOW

* Show results only *after* voting
* Format results better
* Split help on voting into two steps. Radio Button and Vote Button should be separate
